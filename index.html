I completed <a class="journey-links" href="https://reprograma.com.br/">REPROGRAMA</a>'s bootcamp "Todas em Teck - Back End" in Dec/2022 by creating an API intended to help trans people joining sports teams that are trans-frinedly/trans-exclusive called <a class="journey-links" href="https://github.com/SkyAlarcon/Transpire">Transpire</a> and started developing personal projects such as <a class="journey-links" href="https://github.com/SkyAlarcon/Steam-Flashback">Steam Flashback</a>. My hobbies are cycling and practicing swordplay!</p>
